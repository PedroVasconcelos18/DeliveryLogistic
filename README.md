![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-21-blue) <!-- Add a badge for the language used -->

This is a simple project to practice and demonstrate the **Chain of Responsibility** and **Strategy** design patterns in Java. The goal is to understand how these patterns can be applied to solve real-world problems in a clean and maintainable way.

## Overview

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
The **Chain of Responsibility** pattern is used to create a chain of objects that can handle a request. Each object in the chain either handles the request or passes it to the next object in the chain.

### Strategy Pattern
The **Strategy** pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
